               <h2>First Sighting</h2>
               <p>I first saw the hawk a few years ago while on a morning walk. I snapped a quick pic with my phone and then rushed back home to grab my camera in hopes of getting a better shot. Unfortunately by the time I had gotten back to the tree where the hawk was perched it had flown away.

               <h2>Outside My Window</h2>
               <p>
                  The next time I saw the Hawk it was perched right outside my bedroom window. This time it was very easy to grab my camera right away and get some good shots!

               <p>
                  After being able to get a good look at it for the first time I was able to determine it was a Red-Tailed Hawk, I also made a guess that it was prbably a male because while it was a large bird it was on the smaller side for Red-Tailed Hawks and the males of that species are smaller. The males are also typically the ones out hunting while the larger females stay back to defend the nest. I decided to give it a name and decided Apollo was fitting.

               <p>
                  Exactly 1 year later to the day I saw Apollo again! This time it was while on a walk on a rainey day and luckily when I returned with my camera he was still in the same area!

                  I'm looking forward to the day I'll get to see Apollo again and hopefully next time I'll be able to get an even better picture of him in flight!
